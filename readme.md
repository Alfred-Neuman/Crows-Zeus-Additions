## Crows Zeus Additions

Simple clientside mod that requires ACE and Ares or ZEN. It adds whatever functions I wanted as zeus modules. 

Currently including:
* Inflict ACE Medical damage to unit with selection of limb, damage-type and damage. (Useful for medic training of specific wounds. Logs dmg and target in RPT log files when used)
* Remove trees. Remove trees in an distance from position. Works globally and should work for JIP. Removes collision of removed objects
* Animal Follower. Spawns an animal that follows the selected player around

Requires Zeus Enhanced (ZEN) or ARES. 
**OBS. Only tested with ZEN**
